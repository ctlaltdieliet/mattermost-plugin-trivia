# Mattermost Trivia Plugin 

This plugin lets you host your own Trivia Quiz.

You can create a Quiz for a specific channel.

You can add questions (and the answer to the question)

A bot can post the question and checks if someone replies with the correct answer.

Still Work in Progress

Much of the code is inspired by the [Mattermost Todo Plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-todo/)
